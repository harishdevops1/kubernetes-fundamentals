Kubernetes Architecture:
========================


* Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

* Node:
  =====

	* Machine (Physical or Virtual) where Kubernetes is installed.
	
Cluster:
=========

	* collection of nodes grouped together
	
Master:
========

	* Manages the Cluster
	* Node with kubernetes installed in it.
	

Components:
============

	* API Server - Frontend for Kubernetes
	* etcd - Key:Value store
	* kubelet - agent that runs in each node in the cluster. 
				Responsible for containers are running on the server as expected.
	* Container Runtime - underlying software to run container
	* Controller - Brain behind Orchestration
	* Scheduler - distrbuting work across multiple nodes
	
Master vs Worker Nodes:
========================

* Worker - Containers are hosted (Node or Minion)
* API Server - Kubelet
* data is stored in etcd K:V store in master


Master (kube-api server) 	<================>		Worker (Kubelet)
	   (controller)
	   (Scheduler)
	   (etcd)



Kubectl:
========

kubectl run hello-minikube
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
